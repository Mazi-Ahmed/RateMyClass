# RateMyClass

Inspired by RateMyProfessor, I wanted to create a web application where you'll have the ability to find and rate classes. When I was choosing a software engineering course, there was a plethora of options and I didn't know where to start. With RateMyClass, you'll be able to find reviews from actual students/teachers for every and all types of classes.

Technologies utilized:
JavaScript, Node.js, Mongoose, Express and EJS

Approach taken:
Built based off wireframes as guidance. 
Created two databases, consisting of class details and ratings. Users are able to manipulate ratings by creating, editing, and deleting reviews.

Unsolved Problems:
Inconsistencies within my code with a lot of repetition. 
Difficulty to get both datasets working asynchronously, so I have a models folder that isn't being utilized.
Search feature does not have any functionality.

Notes for Future Reference:
Revisit search feature
Add ability to login/signup
Overall rating scores to change based on new reviews
Users can add a new class

User Stories:
As a user, I want to be taken to a clean and simple to use homepage so that I can easily navigate to classes and see ratings.
As a user, I want to be able to publish my own ratings so I can see my rating amongst other ratings for the class.
As a user, i want to be able to edit my ratings in case I made an error or have changed my opinions.
